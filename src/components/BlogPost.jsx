                What if your company could increase its profit margins by 5% overnight?<br/><br/> With AI-driven pricing, companies are not just improving margins—they're transforming how they approach pricing altogether. 
                <br/><br/> 
                By 2025, over 80% of large retailers are expected to adopt AI for pricing decisions.

              <SectionHeader title="The Evolution of Pricing Strategies" />
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Historically, businesses have relied on pricing models such as cost-plus, market-driven, and basic forms of dynamic pricing. While these methods have served companies well in the past, they're increasingly inadequate in today's data-rich, fast-moving markets.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                The limitations of these traditional models lie in their inability to process and respond to the vast amount of data now available. With rapidly evolving market dynamics, competitor pricing, customer behavior, and inventory changes, businesses require more sophisticated systems to stay competitive. This is where AI steps in, offering real-time data integration and predictive analytics for more accurate pricing decisions.

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Machine learning (ML) plays a critical role in modern AI-driven pricing strategies. Here are some of the models and techniques commonly used to predict optimal pricing decisions:
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-200 mb-4">1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)</h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                ARIMA is a popular statistical model used to analyze time series data, like pricing trends. It’s particularly good at forecasting based on historical data. Think of it as a way to predict future prices by examining patterns from the past.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-200 mb-4">2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)</h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                LSTM is a type of neural network used to capture complex patterns in data, especially when information changes over time. In pricing, LSTM helps by analyzing long-term trends, such as how demand shifts over time and how seasonal patterns affect pricing. It’s like a highly advanced pattern detector that adjusts prices in real-time.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-200 mb-4">3. Reinforcement Learning</h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning where the AI learns to make decisions by receiving feedback (rewards or penalties) based on its actions. In pricing, this model can continuously adapt and learn the best prices based on real-time outcomes—like a system that gets smarter with every sale.

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                As AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated pricing strategies to emerge. Key trends to watch include hyper-personalization, predictive pricing, ethical AI pricing, and integration with IoT. 
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Major retailers like Best Buy are already experimenting with hyper-personalized pricing, offering dynamic discounts based on individual browsing history and past purchases. As AI models become more advanced, businesses will be able to predict market changes before they occur, allowing them to set optimal prices proactively rather than reactively.
